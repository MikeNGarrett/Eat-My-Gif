Eat My Gif
======
Dead simple drop in php script for publishing an animated gif archive.
[Take a look](http://redgarrett.com/gifs/)

![Yay!](http://redgarrett.com/gifs/a/25_yay2.gif "Yay!")

 * Animated Gifs!
 * Lots of them! 
 * CDN-hosted javascript
 * [Isotope.js](https://github.com/desandro/isotope) support by @desandro
 * Pagination
 * Drop-in directory scanning
 * Only basic styling
 * Order by modified date
 * Info on when files were uploaded


Installation
----------
Requires Apache, php and somewhere to stick it.

Usage
-----
I have this script [installed on my server](http://redgarrett.com/gifs/). 
Index.php is in the `gifs` directory and my files are stored in `gifs/a`. 
If you just want to drop it in I suggest replicating the same setup.

Configure
---------
You change some configuration instructions in the index.php file.

So far you have the ability to change 
* Your gif directory relative to index.php
* The gif you want to start with
* How many gifs per page
* The page you want to start on
* Your twitter username (for contact info)

Development Recommendations
----------
Give your own spin. I **highly** encourage people to stick in their own js and css to make it their own. 

Don't make it ugly.
